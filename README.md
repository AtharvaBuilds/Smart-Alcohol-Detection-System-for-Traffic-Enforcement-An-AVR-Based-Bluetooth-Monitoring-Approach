# Smart-Alcohol-Detection-System-for-Traffic-Enforcement-An-AVR-Based-Bluetooth-Monitoring-Approach
Real- Time Alcohol Detection System for Traffic Police that combines a MQ-3 alcohol sensor with an AVR microcontroller (ATmega328P). Real-time alcohol consumption detection is built into the system, which will sound an alert via an LED and buzzer when the measured blood alcohol content rises above the 0.08 mg/L legal limit. To facilitate smooth integration with mobile applications for real-time monitoring and data logging, it also integrates wireless data transmission via an HC-05 Bluetooth module. The system's small size guarantees portability, which makes it appropriate for use in workplaces, checkpoints, and automobiles. Because of its low cost, it is more appealing as a practical substitute for conventional breathalysers, which encourages broader use by traffic police.
